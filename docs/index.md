# Welcome to Shannon Bench

Shannon Bench is a radio channel simulation and benchmarking tool.

## Features

- **Channel Simulation**: Simulate various radio channels including AWGN, Rayleigh fading, and more.
- **Benchmarking**: Evaluate the performance of different modulation and coding schemes.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new channel models and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with Shannon Bench, install the package and run the simulation:

```bash
pip install shannon-bench
```

See the [API Reference](api.md) for detailed documentation of the available modules and classes.
